## Spotify Integration 🎧

Remani now supports Spotify URLs with intelligent YouTube conversion:

### Supported Spotify URLs
- **Tracks**: `https://open.spotify.com/track/...`
- **Playlists**: `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/...`
- **Albums**: `https://open.spotify.com/album/...`

### How It Works
1. **Smart Matching**: Uses advanced algorithms to find the best YouTube match
2. **High Accuracy**: Matches by title, artist, and duration for precise results
3. **Background Processing**: Large playlists are processed in the background
4. **Fallback Search**: If Spotify search fails, falls back to YouTube search

### Example Usage
```
/play https://open.spotify.com/track/4iV5W9uYEdYUVa79Axb7Rh
/play https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M
/play bad guy billie eilish
```

## Setup 🛠️

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ 
- Discord Bot Token
- Discord Application Client ID
- **Spotify API Credentials** (for Spotify features)
- **Windows only**: yt-dlp via WinGet (recommended for local development)
- **Render/Railway**: yt-dlp auto-downloads during deployment ✅

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd "Discord Bot"
```

2. **Get Spotify API Credentials** (Optional but recommended)
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Create a new app
   - Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

3. **Install yt-dlp (Windows only - for local development)**
```powershell
winget install yt-dlp.yt-dlp
```
**Note**: On Render/Railway (Linux), yt-dlp is automatically downloaded by `youtube-dl-exec` package. No manual installation needed! 🎉

4. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

5. **Create `.env` file in root directory**
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
CLIENT_ID=your_application_client_id_here

# Optional: For Spotify features
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here
```

6. **Deploy commands to Discord**
```bash
npm run deploy
```

7. **Start the bot**
```bash
npm start
```

## Deployment 🚀

### Render (Recommended for Free Hosting)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   - Make sure `.env` is in `.gitignore`
   - Commit and push all code

2. **Create new Web Service on Render**
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Click "New +" → "Worker"
   - Connect your GitHub repository

3. **Configure the service**
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - **Instance Type**: Free

4. **Add Environment Variables**
   - `DISCORD_TOKEN` = your bot token
   - `CLIENT_ID` = your client ID
   - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` = your Spotify client ID (optional)
   - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` = your Spotify client secret (optional)
   - `NODE_ENV` = production

5. **Deploy!**
   - Click "Create Worker"
   - Wait for deployment to complete

**Note:** Render's free tier has 750 hours/month. For 24/7 uptime, consider upgrading to paid tier ($7/month).

**Important**: The bot automatically detects the platform:
- ✅ On Render/Railway (Linux), it uses the bundled yt-dlp binary
- ✅ No additional configuration needed
- ✅ Everything works out of the box!

### Railway (Alternative Free Option)

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. Create new project → Deploy from GitHub
4. Add environment variables (DISCORD_TOKEN, CLIENT_ID)
5. Deploy!

Railway offers $5 free credit monthly, then pay-as-you-go.

### Other Hosting Options

- **VPS (Full Control)**: DigitalOcean ($6/mo), Linode, Vultr
- **Self-hosting**: Run on your own computer (requires 24/7 uptime)
- **Heroku**: No longer offers free tier

**⚠️ Vercel is NOT recommended** - It's designed for serverless functions, not persistent Discord bots.

## Environment Variables 🔐

Create a `.env` file with:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
CLIENT_ID=your_application_client_id_here

# Optional: For Spotify features
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here
```

**How to get these values:**

1. **Discord Credentials:**
   - Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Select your application
   - **Bot Token**: Bot tab → Reset Token → Copy
   - **Client ID**: OAuth2 → General → Application ID

2. **Spotify Credentials (Optional):**
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Create a new app
   - Copy **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
   - **Note**: Without Spotify credentials, the bot will work with YouTube only

## Bot Permissions 🔑

When inviting the bot, ensure it has:
- ✅ Send Messages
- ✅ Embed Links
- ✅ Connect (Voice)
- ✅ Speak (Voice)
- ✅ Use Slash Commands

**Invite URL Template:**
```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=36718592&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

## Dependencies 📦

All packages are in `package.json` and will install automatically:

**Core:**
- `discord.js` - Discord API wrapper
- `@discordjs/voice` - Voice connections
- `@discordjs/opus` - Audio encoding

**Audio Processing:**
- `youtube-dl-exec` - yt-dlp wrapper (auto-downloads binary)
- `play-dl` - YouTube metadata
- `youtube-sr` - YouTube search
- `ffmpeg-static` - Audio processing
- `@snazzah/davey` - DAVE protocol (modern encryption)

**Spotify Integration:**
- `axios` - HTTP client for Spotify API calls

**Other:**
- `dotenv` - Environment variables
- `genius-lyrics` - Lyrics fetching

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Commands not showing in Discord
```bash
npm run deploy
```
Wait 5-10 minutes for Discord to sync globally.

### Bot won't join voice channel
- Check bot has "Connect" and "Speak" permissions
- Ensure you're in a voice channel when using `/play`
- Try `/join` command first

### No audio playing
- Bot is playing but you can't hear? Check Discord voice settings
- Ensure the video isn't geo-restricted
- Try a different song

### "Cannot utilize the DAVE protocol" error
```bash
npm install @snazzah/davey
```

### yt-dlp not found (deployment)
The bot uses `youtube-dl-exec` which automatically downloads yt-dlp binary on first run. If issues persist:
```bash
npm install youtube-dl-exec --save
```

## Development 💻

**Development mode (auto-restart on changes):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Update slash commands:**
```bash
npm run deploy
```

**Check logs on Render:**
- Go to your service dashboard
- Click "Logs" tab
- Monitor real-time output

## How It Works 🏗️

1. **Custom Queue System**: Manages song queue, repeat modes, and playback state
2. **yt-dlp Integration**: Extracts direct stream URLs, bypassing YouTube restrictions
3. **Spotify Integration**: Uses Spotify Web API + intelligent YouTube matching
4. **Smart Search Algorithm**: Multi-strategy search with similarity scoring
5. **Voice Connection**: Uses Discord's DAVE protocol for encrypted voice
6. **Interactive UI**: Music panels with buttons for easy control
7. **Cross-Platform**: 
   - **Windows**: Uses WinGet-installed yt-dlp (no path issues)
   - **Linux/Mac/Render**: Uses bundled yt-dlp binary (auto-downloads)
   - **No configuration needed** - works everywhere!

## Limitations ⚠️

- Spotify playlists require API credentials for full functionality
- Large playlists (500+ songs) are processed in background
- Free hosting has potential downtime (upgrade for 24/7)
- Some region-restricted content may not be available

## Updates & Maintenance 🔄

To update the bot:
```bash
git pull
npm install
npm run deploy  # if commands changed
npm start
```
